                <p>Released in 2003, <a href="https://www.metasploit.com/" target="_blank">Metasploit </a>originally had only 11 exploits. However, since being acquired by Rapid7 in 2009, Metasploit has become an open-source program, which has now amassed over 2,300 exploits and almost 4,000 modules and payloads. Metasploit is now one of the worldâ€™s most popular frameworks for automating many aspects of penetration testing. 
                    Many zero-day reports also include a Metasploit module as proof-of-concept.<br><br>Metasploit integrates with the open-source Metasploit Framework to provide a wide range of exploitation and reconnaissance modules. It incorporates numerous attacker techniques, such as finding weak credentials (e.g. recycled passwords), evading antivirus and other security software, and finding backdoors, so as to maintain persistence throughout a network. Metasploit also contains a vast library of ready-made codes and viruses (and allows you the tools to build custom-made malware!) into a network. Among other things, these codes can simulate real-world social engineering or phishing campaigns to harvest credentials and deliver payloads.
                     They can also run brute-force attacks against databases, web servers, and remote administration solutions. Like we said: it is powerful.</p>
